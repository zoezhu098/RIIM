\title{The regularized post-matching probability function}
\description{
This function is conducted for regularizing post-matching probabilities to avoid non-informative confidence intervals and large sample variance, proposed in Zhu and Heng (2024).
}
\usage{
conditional_p = function(treated.subject.index,matched.control.subject.index,p,gamma=0.1)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{treated.subject.index}{The index list for treated subjects after matching.}
  \item{matched.control.subject.index}{The index list for control subjects after matching.}
  \item{p}{The propensity score vector.}
  \item{gamma}{Prespecified small number. The default is 0.1.}

}

\value{
  \item{prob}{The regularized post-matching probabilities vector.}
